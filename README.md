# polymer-form

A MVP example of a login form using Polymer.

## Setup

Clone the project locally:

    git clone git@github.com:tonyedwardspz/polymer-form.git

Then, go ahead and download the element's dependencies:

    bower install

Then install polyserve, a tool for running stand alone elements:

    npm install polyserve -g
    
From the project root run the following from the command line:

    polyserve
    
Once running, you can preview your element at
`http://localhost:8080/components/polymer-form/demo/`, where `polymer-form` is the name of the directory containing it.
